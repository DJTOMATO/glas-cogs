# Umineko Cog

Umineko Screenshot Generator, using the **PS3** sprites and backgrounds.

Based on [mochidaz/umineko-screenshot-generator-ps3](https://github.com/mochidaz/umineko-screenshot-generator-ps3)


# Usage Syntax
 - Usage: `[p]umi text`
 - To use the colored truths add ``red;gold;blue;white`` to each phrase.
 - Use ``\n`` to break lines

# Example:
 - ``/umi text1: red;This is red, blue;this is blue, gold;this is gold. \n white;this is a new line, but golden;golden \n\n\n white;NEW LINES DON'T EXIST \n\n\n red;NEW LINES EXIST BATTLER HAHAHAHA left: Beatrice center: Battler Ushiromiya right: Virgilia bg: Main Building``

Because of love, you end up 'seeing' things that don't even exist.```
