## MakeSweet Cog

For this cog to work properly you need to compile ``reanimator``by yourself!
I included a pre-compiled version for ARM64, but if you use another architecture you have to clone from  https://github.com/paulfitz/makesweet/tree/master/src and compile yourself!

## error while loading shared libraries
Install reanimator dependencys ``sudo apt-get install libgd-dev libzzip-dev libopencv-highgui-dev libopencv-videoio-dev libjsoncpp-dev libprotobuf-dev``
